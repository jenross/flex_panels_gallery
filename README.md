# Flex Panels Gallery

## About 

This is the fifth of 30 vanilla JS challenges in Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 series. The focus of the challenge was implementing flex characteristics on a gallery of photos (in panel format). In addition to adding the flex properties to the panels in CSS, event listeners were added to the JS code to add the appropriate toggle open and active classes (which cue transitions) when the panels are clicked on.  

## Technologies Used
